<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The CanonicalResource represents resources that have a canonical URL:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>They have a canonical URL (note: all resources with a canonical URL are specializations of this type)</li>
 <li>They have version, status, and data properties to help manage their publication</li>
 <li>They carry some additional metadata about their use, including copyright information</li>
</ul>

<p>
As an interface, this type is never created directly - see <a href="uml.html#interfaces">Resource Interfaces</a> for more details.
